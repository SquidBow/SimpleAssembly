# Simple Assembly
An pseudo assembly interpreter written in zig

#Writing:
    register = r + number
    string = " + string + "

#Sections
.data - for declaring variables
To declear a variable do: [name] [DataType] [Value]
To declear a string do: [name] [string]

.code - for instructions

#Instructions
Short:
    Label = value/string
    DataType = db/dw/dd/string
    Variable = DataType/Length (if a string)
    Operand = register/value/string/Variable

Instructions:
    add [register] [Operand] - adds a value from the Operand with a value from the register and saves to the register
    sub [register] [Operand] - subtracts a value from the Operand from a value from the register and saves to the register
    mov [register] [Operand] - puts a value from the Operand into the register overwriting its contents
    cmp [Operand] [Operand] - compares 2 values gotten from the Operands and sets flags
    mul [register] [Operand] - multiplies the value in the register by the value in the Operand and puts the result in the register
    div [register] [Operand] - divides the value in the register by the value in the Operand and puts the result in the register
    mod [register] [Operand] - divides the value in the register by the value in the Operand and puts the reminder in the register
    and [register] [Operand] - logical and on the register with the value from the Operand
    or [register] [Operand] - logical or on the register with the value from the Operand
    xor [register] [Operand] - logical xor on the register with the value from the Operand
    shl [register] - bit shift left on the value in the register
    shr [register] - bit shift right on the value in the register
    print [Operand] - prints a value from the Operand as a string/char
    printNum [Operand] - prints the value from the Operand as a number
    write [destination: Operand] [data: Operand] - writes data from the data Operand into the ram position destination Operand
    read [register] [Operand] [DataType] (optional. Default dd) - moves the data from the ram at position of Operand value into the register
    MovRam [destination: Operand] [data: Operand] [Variable] - writes data from ram position at data ram Operand value to ram at position at destination Operand value
    push [register] - pushes the value of the register into the stack
    pop [register] - pops the value from the stack into the register
    input [Operand] [Variable] - saves the input in desired DataType into a ram at location of the value of the Operand

Jumps:
    jmp [Label] - jumps to a location of the label
    je [Label] - jumps to a location if the zero flag is set to 1
    jne [Label] - jumps to a location if the zero flag is set to 0
    jl [Label] - jumps to a location if the less flag is set to 1
    jg [Label] - jumps to a location if both zero and less flags are set to 0
    jle [Label] - jumps to a location if the zero flag is 1 or the less flag is 1
    jge [Label] - jumps to a location if the less flag is set to 0


#Procedures
Declare main proc with: main:

To declare proc use: proc [name]
To call a proc use: call [name]

Each proc has to have a "ret" statement where it ends
